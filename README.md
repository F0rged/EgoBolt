Ego Battery Adapter for Jetson Bolt Pro

Background:
I have always liked the idea of going for family bike rides.  Unfortunately, my daughter (8 years old) was never very enthusastic about the idea and was generally quite resistant to the idea whenever the suggestion would come up.
I thought, maybe if I could build her an electric bike, she might be more ethusiastic.
Unfortunately, there don't seem to be many kid-friendly e-bikes out there.
Except for one: the jetson bolt Pro.
I picked up a used one in good shape for about $250CAD, and it worked well.
But of course, the battery is nearing the end of its life and the charge doesnt last as long as it should.
Therefore, a new battery is required.
